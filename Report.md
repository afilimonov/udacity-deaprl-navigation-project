### Approach

These are main steps for developing an agent to solve Banana collection environment:

* Install the environment and equired dependencies.
* Denfine the environment and examine state and action space.
* Take random action in the environmenbt and collect the feedback. This establishes the baseline.
* Define basic Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) agents.
* Train DQN and DDQN agents and save trained models for each agent.
* Plot the training results.
* Test DQN and DDQN agents.
* Plot the testing resutls.
